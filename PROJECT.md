# PROJECT.md — Cauvery Resorts Website

---

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Cauvery Resorts Website  
**Live URL:** https://www.cauveryresorts.com/  
**Purpose:** Marketing and lead-generation website for a family-run pilgrim resort near Talacauvery and Bhagamandala, Coorg (Karnataka, India). All bookings are handled through WhatsApp and phone — there is no online payment or reservation system.

### Main Features
- Enquiry form that POSTs to `/api/enquiry` (saved to Postgres, owner and guest emailed via Resend); if the server is unreachable it offers a pre-filled WhatsApp message via `wa.me` as a fallback
- Hero image slideshow (Swiper.js)
- Room catalogue with pricing
- Photo gallery with lightbox
- Google Reviews showcase
- FAQ accordion
- Interactive Google Maps embed
- WhatsApp floating chat bubble (popup)
- Mobile sticky CTA bar (Call / WhatsApp / Enquire)
- Splash screen on first visit (session-gated)
- Animated stat counters
- Page transition animation
- Cookie consent banner
- PWA support (manifest + offline page)
- Schema.org structured data (LodgingBusiness, HotelRoom, BreadcrumbList, WebPage)
- SEO landing pages for local search terms

### User Roles
| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Visitor | Any person browsing the website. No login required. |
| Admin | Resort owner/staff — uses `backend/views/admin.html` (standalone admin panel, purpose unclear from code) |

### Technology Stack
| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Markup | HTML5 (static, no templating engine) |
| Styling | Custom CSS (`assets/css/design-v2.css`, ~3 700 lines) |
| Scripting | Vanilla JavaScript (inline per-page + `assets/js/main.js`) |
| Slider | Swiper.js v11 (CDN) |
| Icons | Font Awesome 6.5.0 (CDN) |
| Fonts | Google Fonts — Playfair Display, Inter |
| PWA | `manifest.json` + `offline.html` + `404.html` |
| Structured Data | Schema.org JSON-LD |
| Build tooling | Tailwind CSS v4 + `@tailwindcss/typography` installed via npm, but **not used in production** — all styles come from `design-v2.css` |

## Data Models

No database exists. All data is hard-coded in HTML. These are the inferred entities:

### Room
| Field | Example Value |
|-------|--------------|
| id | "rooms-1-2" |
| name | "Large Family Room" |
| maxOccupancy | 10 |
| pricePerNight | 1500 (INR) |
| priceCurrency | "INR" |
| amenities | ["Hot Water", "WiFi", "Attached Bathroom", "AC"] |
| images | ["resort4.webp"] |
| badge | "Rooms 1 & 2" |
| roomNumbers | [1, 2] |

**Room Types:**
- Standard Non-AC Room — ₹1,500/night, up to 3
- Deluxe AC Room — ₹2,500/night, up to 3
- Cosy Couple Room — up to 2
- Large Family Room — up to 10
- Pilgrim Dormitory — ₹400/person, up to 50
- Pilgrim / Group Hall — up to 50

### Booking Enquiry (ephemeral — sent to WhatsApp)
| Field | Type |
|-------|------|
| name | string (required) |
| phone | string (required) |
| checkIn | date |
| checkOut | date |
| guests | enum ("1-2", "3-5", "6-10", "11-25", "26-50", "50+") |
| roomType | enum ("Any Room", "AC Room", "Non-AC Room", "Family Room", "Group Hall", "Day Bathing") |

### Review (hard-coded)
| Field | Type |
|-------|------|
| reviewerName | string |
| avatar | string (initial letter + color) |
| stars | number (1–5) |
| text | string |
| date | string ("5 months ago") |
| source | "Google" |
| subRatings | {rooms, service, location} |

### Nearby Attraction
| Field | Type |
|-------|------|
| name | string |
| distance | string ("2 km", "500 m") |
| description | string |
| image | string (path to webp) |
| icon | FontAwesome class |

### Resort (singleton)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| name | Cauvery Resorts / Cauvery Yatrika Dhama |
| phone | +91-944-9485133, +91-996-4785133 |
| email | cauveryresorts@gmail.com |
| coordinates | 12.385989, 75.5120069 |
| founded | 2008 |
| totalRooms | 30 |
| googleRating | 4.2 / 120 reviews |
| checkIn | 12:00 |
| checkOut | 11:00 |

## Third-Party Dependencies

| Dependency | Source | Used For |
|------------|--------|----------|
| **Swiper.js v11** | CDN (jsdelivr) | Hero image slideshow, Google Reviews carousel |
| **Font Awesome 6.5.0** | CDN (cdnjs) | All icons (phone, WhatsApp, bed, star, etc.) |
| **Google Fonts** | CDN | Playfair Display (headings), Inter (body) |
| **Google Maps Embed API** | iframe embed | Location map on homepage and contact page |
| **WhatsApp Click-to-Chat** | `wa.me` protocol | All booking and contact CTAs |
| **Tailwind CSS v4** | npm (local) | Installed but **not used** in production pages |
| **@tailwindcss/typography** | npm (local) | Installed but **not used** |
| **AOS (Animate On Scroll)** | Not loaded | `data-aos` attributes appear on elements but AOS library is **never loaded** — animations silently do nothing |

---

## Current Problems

### 1. Duplicate HTML across all pages
The navbar (≈15 lines), footer (≈60 lines), floating buttons, mobile CTA bar, and cookie banner are copy-pasted into every one of ~20 HTML files. Changing the phone number or adding a nav item requires editing every file by hand.

### 2. Monolithic CSS file
`design-v2.css` is ~3 700 lines long with no modular separation. Several selectors appear twice at different line numbers (`.fab-wa` at lines 1368 and 2994, `#stickyBar` at 1335 and 3073, `.hero__trust-float` at 2792 and 3451). The later rule silently overrides the earlier one.

### 3. AOS library never loaded
Every section has `data-aos="fade-up"` attributes but the AOS library script is never imported. Scroll animations are completely non-functional.

### 4. Hardcoded phone number (×10+ places)
`+919449485133` appears as a raw string in href attributes, WhatsApp links, and JSON-LD across all pages. Changing the number requires a global find-and-replace across every file.

### 5. Inline styles throughout HTML
Hundreds of `style="…"` attributes set colors, margins, border-radius, and layout. Example: `style="background:linear-gradient(140deg,#2D3258,#1A1F3A);"` hardcoded on a section element. This makes visual changes inconsistent and untraceable.

### 6. No shared JS module
JavaScript is written inline at the bottom of each page separately. Common behaviour (navbar scroll, page transition, cookie banner, WhatsApp popup toggle) is copy-pasted with slight variations per page.

### 7. Tailwind installed but unused
The `node_modules` directory (~150+ files) adds bulk to the project for zero production benefit. `tailwind-input.css` exists but its output is never used.

### 8. Tight coupling of content and structure
All content (room prices, review text, attraction descriptions) is embedded directly in HTML with no separation of data from presentation.

### 9. Inline `<script>` blocks inside `<body>`
The WhatsApp popup toggle script, stat counter, Swiper init, lightbox, and cookie logic all live as `<script>` blocks scattered within the HTML body, making maintenance difficult.

### 10. No image optimisation pipeline
Images are delivered as `.webp` files manually but there is no responsive `srcset`, no lazy-loading fallback, and no automated optimisation step.

### 11. `backend/views/admin.html` — unclear purpose
This file exists but has no server, no API, and no authentication — it appears to be an abandoned or placeholder admin UI.
